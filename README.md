## About Me

Hi there! I’m a software developer, and I love working on building websites. My focus is on full-stack development, and I enjoy working with CSS and creating animations in my free time. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects and always looking to learn new skills to improve my work.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me reading manhwa 📚 or watching anime 🎬. They’re big parts of my life and keep me motivated and inspired.

I’m also really interested in cybersecurity 🔐 and want to learn how to become a good security analyst. It’s a field that excites me because it combines problem-solving with making the digital world safer.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about tech, anime, manhwa, or anything else. I’d love to connect!

Thanks for stopping by!
